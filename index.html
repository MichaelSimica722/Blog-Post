                    Hello! Thank you for taking the time to check out my blog. This post was created using HTML5, CSS3 and a dash of creativity! Let me introduce myself. My name is Michael and I'm 23 years old. I graduated from the University of North Georgia in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science. In addition to my major, I have a concentration in Information Assurance/Security. Along with Software Engineering, Computer Security always interested me so I focused my electives in that sub-field of Computer Science. I found that there is a lot of overlap between Computer Security and general software development. Being able to write code and develop software is one thing, but developing secure code is a whole different beast! My education has helped me transfer what I learned in the class room to the real-world environment. I am currently a Database Specialist for the Lab Depot (will expand more on my duties in the work experience section!) and have been able to directly apply my SQL knowledge and general cyber security knowledge to live databases. During my down time at home, I enjoy dabbling with different technologies and creating fun projects out of them. For example, I really enjoy fitness and decided that I would create a fitness website to build something cool!

               Currently, I am working on building a website for a fitness company called iFit. I will be using HTML/CSS to develop this website and develop a beautiful web page. I'd like this page to have 4 main sections: Mission statement, Services Offered, Locations/Hours, and a contact info section at the bottom. After I have the site designed the way I'd like it, I would like to deliver some functionality to it using JavaScript. My inspiration for this project stems from combining two of my favorite hobbies, weightlifting/coding into an awesome product!

                <h3> Work Experience</h3>
                <p class = "main-text">
                I started working for The Lab Depot(TLD) as an I.T intern in September 2019. Upon succesfful completion of my internship, I was hired on full time immediately upon graduation as a Database Specialist. I wear many hats at this organization as you will see after I list some of my responsibilities My primary functions at TLD include: database management, writing SQL queries using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to pull reports for various departments, resolving local I.T requests, help Marketing team with mini web development projects, run Data Quality Reports, and serve as the main I.T point of contact between TLD and third party I.T companies. Most of my time is spent in SQL Server and Prophet 21 ERP.

                Now that you have learned about my educational and profesional work background, it's time you learn more about who I am as a person! My main hobbies interest include but are not limited to: weightlifting, hiking, running, spending time with my girlfriend,shopping, and exploring! I'm a very outgoing person and enjoy being in collaborative environments. I believe my passion for development and ability to thrive in a collaborative work environment will allow me to thrive as a Software Engineer.
